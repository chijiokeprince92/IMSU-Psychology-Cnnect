                            STUDENTS OF NATIONAL OPEN UNIVERSITY OF NIGERIA</a></p>

                    <p>The term learning styles refers to the view that different people learn information in different ways.
                        In recent decades, the concept of learning styles has steadily gained influence. Learning styles
                        appear to have wide acceptance not only among educators but also among parents and the general public.

                    <br>
                    <p>Anxiety is a phenomenon that people frequently encounter in their daily life. Anxiety can be described
                        as the tense, unsettling anticipation of a threatening but vague event; a feeling of uneasy suspense
                        (Rachman, 2004). As a result of the nature of anxiety, researchers have provided a classification
                        of this phenomenon into different sub-categories (e.g., language anxiety, speech anxiety, social
                        anxiety).
