      <p><b>GUIDELINES FOR B. SC. DEGREE IN PSYCHOLOGY</b><br><br> <b>1.</b> A four year programme shall be provided
        leading to the award

        Credit units are
        weights assigned to each course as a measure of the amount of work done in those courses. Credit
        units measure course
        weighting as well as an indicator of students’ work load. The stipulated lecture times are two
        lecture contact hours
        per week, or three one hour laboratory field work or practical classes per week throughout a
        semester.<br><br> <b>4.</b>
        There shall be four levels of courses, numbered from <b>101 -122; 221 - 254; 311 -382 and 431 -490.</b>

        of course units
        taken with the grades obtained in each course shall also be recorded for the purpose of computing
        the Cumulative
        Grade Point Average (CGPA).<br><br> <b>7.</b> Continuous Assessments (CA) may be regarded as part of
        course examination
        but marks scored through continuous assessment shall not constitute more than 30% of the full marks

        course units in any semester.<br><br><b>10.</b><br><b>a)</b> The weighted grade points of courses taken shall
        be used for the determination of the class of degree.<br> <b>b)</b> The Cumulative Grade Point Average
        system shall be used for the determination
        of the class of degree.<br><b>c)</b> The minimum number of course units for the award of degree shall
        be 144 units.<br> <b>d)</b> The degree shall be awarded with honours provided a student obtains a

        <b>ii.</b> Assessment in laboratory/field/clinics or combination as may be applicable.<br><br>
        <b>14. GRADE POINT (GP)</b><br> The mark scored in each course (continuous assessment and end-of
        semester examination
        score) has an equivalent letter grade of A to F, and each letter grade has a corresponding
        numerical value of 5.00
        to 0.00 called a grade point.<br><br>
        <b>15. GRADE POINT AVERAGE (GPA)</b><br> <b>a)</b> The academic performance of a student in any semester
        shall be measured
        with the Grade Point Average (GPA) which is the sum of quality points divided by total units for
        all the courses
        registered in the semester.<br> <b>b)</b> Quality Point (QP) is the product of the credit unit and grade
        point of each course.<br><br>
        <b>16. CUMULATIVE GRADE POINT AVERAGE (CGPA)</b><br> <b>a)</b> The Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA)
        is the measure
        of the students’ overall academic performance at any given point in his programme.<br> <b>b)</b> The CGPA
        is normally computed
        at the end of each semester as an up-to-date weighted mean of the grade points, where the weights
        are the course
        credit units.<br> <b>c)</b> The Grade Point earned at the end of semester examinations shall count towards
        the CGPA.
        <br> <b>d)</b> The CGPA is the sum of all quality point divided by the sum of all credit units for all
        courses registered/repeated
        so far in the programme.<br> <b>e)</b> The final CGPA obtained at the end of a students’ academic
        programme shall determine
        the class of degree the student shall be awarded.<br> <b>f)</b> Grades to be used for students who
