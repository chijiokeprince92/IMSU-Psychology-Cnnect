The web app is a comprehensive platform that allows students to access a variety of resources, including a library, attendance records, and a chat room. The app also allows students to post images and share them with their classmates.

The frontend of the app is built using HTML, CSS, Handlebars, and Bootstrap. These technologies are used to create a user-friendly interface that is easy to navigate. The backend of the app is built using NodeJS and ExpressJS for the server, Cloudinary for image handling, Socket.IO for handling real time chat, and MongoDB for managing the NoSQL database.
